## BODY

This section basically makes use of a containing element like div to wrap site contents and house our grid system.
The div tag is used to define a division or a section in the site.We use <strong>.container</strong> for a responsive fixed width container.Rows are placed within the .container for proper alignment and padding and to create horizontal groups of columns.
Predefined grid class <strong>.row</strong> is used for quickly making grid layouts.Along with this,Bootstrap <strong>media queries</strong> are used to create the key breakpoints in our grid system.
The <strong>Modal Part</strong> is defined at the end of the body section.
